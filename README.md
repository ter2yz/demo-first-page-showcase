# FirstPage Interview Assessment

This project is an assessment for the FirstPage interview process.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Type Checking:** TypeScript
- **Form Validation:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **Map Integration:** Google Maps via @vis.gl/react-google-maps
- **Hosting:** Netlify

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Lint and format code:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format:fix
```

## üåè Environment Setup (Google Maps)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Google Maps API credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAP_ID=your_map_id_here
```

**Notes:**

- The API key already has appropriate restrictions set up in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for security.
- Google Map Id is required for custom map styling and custom map pointers.
- Google Maps in this app uses the `mapId` for advanced map styling; you can configure map styles in GCP under Map Management.

## üì¨ Contact Form API Route Details

The API route at `app/api/contact/route.ts` acts as a backend-for-frontend (BFF) for the contact form:

- Handles POST requests from the contact form, performing basic validation and logging all requests and errors server-side.
- Returns a mock success response (HTTP 200) or error (HTTP 400/500) for demonstration purposes.
- Supports error simulation using the `forceError` query parameter (see `/contact-showcase` for an example of error handling in the UI).
- Designed to be easily extended for real backend integration or additional server-side logic.

## üß™ API Error Simulation Toggle

A toggle is available on the homepage to simulate API errors. This allows you to easily test and demonstrate error handling in the contact form UI. When enabled, the form will force the API to return an error response.
